                Electric or hybrid vehicles can offer significant reductions in
                emissions over conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles
                produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe
                emissions when operating in all-electric mode
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As a result of regenerative braking, hybrid electric vehicles
                (HEVs) use less fuel than conventional vehicles because their
                electric-drive technology boosts vehicle efficiency.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                In the UK, there are 33,281 public electric vehicle charging
                stations. A total of 6,084 of these are rapid EV chargers.
              </p>

                The EV market is expected to continue growing in the UK as it
                prepares for a ban on petrol and diesel cars in 2030. We believe
                now is a great time to buy an electric vehicle due to
                substantial investments in the UK's charging infrastructure.
