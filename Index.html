                Electric or hybrid vehicles can offer significant reductions in
                emissions over conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles
                produce zero tailpipe emissions, and PHEVs produce no tailpipe
                emissions when operating in all-electric mode
              </p>

              <p>
                As a result of regenerative braking, hybrid electric vehicles
                (HEVs) use less fuel than conventional vehicles because their
                electric-drive technology boosts vehicle efficiency.

                In the UK, there are 33,281 public electric vehicle charging
                stations. A total of 6,084 of these are rapid EV chargers.

                The EV market is expected to continue growing in the UK as it
                prepares for a ban on petrol and diesel cars in 2030. We believe
                now is a great time to buy an electric vehicle due to
                substantial investments in the UK's charging infrastructure.

                Our company name is Electric vehicles which has been created in 2015 when we noticed an increase of the EV market due to
                governemental incentive in US and Europe. A new market for a long period of time has appeared.

                widely we want to encourage this new revolution giving as much as possible informations we can upon the subject.
                Electric vehicule sales may increase from 2% of global share in 2016 to 30% by 2030 (Global EV report outlook 2021).

                sources
                with the advantages and disadvantages specially in term of environment, EV technologies, EV efficiency, EV
                charging
                needs, EV maintenance, EV cost, EV ranges and ...
